This repository is part of the academic project for creating a stock trading bot platform by group A3 of the Artificial Intelligence & Data Science course, in the subject "Applied Project to Industry" (API).

This feature is a part of the API created to run in an AWS EC2 freetier environment for the final project demonstration.

It consists of a chatbot that was initially going to be simple due to computational resource constraints. However, we discovered that Cohere, a pioneer in AI solutions based on NLP and LLMS, provides a free trial key to use their models through an API. Consequently, we updated our chatbot to utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the output generated by our system.
