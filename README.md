> This repository is part of the academic project for creating a stock trading bot platform by group A3 of the Artificial Intelligence & Data Science course, in the subject "Applied Project to Industry" (API).

> This feature is a part of the API created to run in an AWS EC2 freetier environment for the final project demonstration.

> It consists of a chatbot that was initially going to be simple due to computational resource constraints. However, we discovered that Cohere, a pioneer in AI solutions based on NLP and LLMS, provides a free trial key to use their models through an API. Consequently, we updated our chatbot to utilize Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the output generated by our system.
The data in this repository are only for testing; the final versions of the "knowledge bases" we created for the project will not be made available here.
Below is an explanation of the architecture of our solution:
